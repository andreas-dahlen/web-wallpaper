list from top layer= SRC > animations, assets, components, composables, config, input, reactiveStates, scenes, styles, backups, app.vue, main.js, TODO.txt

animations > touchVisuals.js (currently unused animation delegation)

assets > icons, images, sounds (currently unused)

components >
	buttonGrid.vue (grid of buttons using v-for calling TouchArea components)
	DebugPanel.vue (new thing... currently not implemented)
	SwipeCarousel.vue (how i used to make Carousel components)
	SwipeZones.vue (invisible zone containing TouchArea components that only handels the input and registered it)
	TouchArea.vue (a component i use everywhere i want to register touch/swipes whatever)

composables > useScale.js (scale config apply)

config > appSettings.js (handels all types of configs... exports mainly APP_SETTINGS and DEBUG objects)

this is the current reworked part and im not completly used to how/what files do :p ===
input > bus, core, debug, drivers, gestures
	
	bus > gestureBus.js (subscribed and unsubscribes listeners to a set)
		gestureTypes.js (contract between JS and kotlin)

	core > inputRegistry.js (replaced inputEngine registraction)
		inputRouter.js (handels the mode if im running on JS or Android from app_settings.inputMode js or android)

	debug > inputDebug.js (exports log function, drawdot, gestureBusLog and debugLagTime that can be called to track different stuff in console and drawdot is to visually track input during tests)

	drivers > (this is what used to be called engine)
		androidInputDriver.js ( Expose global handleTouch for Android WebView bridge)
		jsInputDriver.js (JS-only input driver... used for debuging i guess)

	gestures > pressGesture.js (not sure... handels FSMstates and emits stuff)
		swipeGestures.js (same thing i guess for swipes)

	reactiveStates > SwipeState.js (an old file that exported a reactive const for swipe places)
	
scenes > lanes > bottom > a.vue, b.vue, c.vue 
		mid > ....
		top > ....
		wallpaper ....
		(decides what shows in different types of carousels)


	BKGimage.vue (positioning for the wallpaper carousel)
	ZoneLayout.vue (positioning and stuff for the top, mid, bottom carousels)
	WallpaperRoot.vue (this is where almost everything is being mounted)

backups (contains deletable files tbf.. already have git branch backups)

App.vue (wallpaperRoot.vue is mounted here)

main.js (main JS stuff :p)

TODO.txt (a list of stuff that needs to be done.. currently old and unused)


kotlin has files aswell they are JSBridge.kt, WallpaperService.kt, engine.kt and debug.kt basically...

list from top layer= SRC > animations, assets, components, composables, config, data, input, scenes, styles, backups, app.vue, main.js, TODO.txt

animations > tochVisuals.js (was used to handel CSS logic using el.style.setProperty... currently unused...

assets > icons, images, sound

components > SwipeCarousel.vue (template for lanes), swipeZones.vue (positioned absolute input layer), TouchArea.vue (i use this everywhere... if i need a touch i use it :P)

composables > useScale.js (handles scaling on #app), swipeEngine.js (handels some swipe logic or whatever xD)

config > appSettings.js

data > SwipeState.js

input > inputEngine.js (main engine that registers swipes, button down and button up etc), nativeBridge.js (translate between kotlin and inputEngine), debugInput.js (debug functions that can be called... currently fairly defective... )

scenes > lanes > top, bottom, middle (these contain a,b,c for all current lanezones..


scenes > WallpaperRoot.vue (the one file that is responsible for the whole layout), ZoneLayout.vue (suppose to be responsible for how the lanes should be ported into WallpaperRoot... currently does nothing)

styles > (all my CSS that isn't vue file specific) 

xBACKUPS

app.vue only calls WallpaperRoot and useScale

main.js = import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import './input/nativeBridge'
import './styles/main.css'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
